Week 1
Introduction to Optimizing a Website for Google Search
Welcome to week 1! As you may remember from Module 4 within the last course, Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals, keywords are an extremely important tool for helping your customers find you in an often crowded field. Effective use of keywords on your optimized website can result in free targeted traffic to your site, helping you to reach your business goals. In this module, you will use the keyword research you conducted in the last course and you will learn a process for selecting the best keywords to optimize your website in search results. We will look at concepts like relevancy to the site, keyword intent, how competitive the keyword is in organic search, and how well that term might convert once it receives traffic. We’ll also discuss how to identify and evaluate competitors, how to map keywords to pages, and how to create a keyword map for your clients and your own site. There is a lot to discuss in our first module, so if you are taking this course without learning the materials of module 4 within the SEO Fundamentals course, I highly recommend you complete that module before diving into this one. So, let’s get started learning how to apply keyword research!

Advanced SEO Strategies
Welcome to module 2! While keywords help users locate relevant web pages, it’s the content itself that determines whether a click converts to a sale or increased site traffic. In many corners of the SEO world, the expression “Content is King” is a generally accepted rule, and in this module we’ll examine content from many perspectives: how to analyze it, organize it, create it, make it great and build it into our strategies. You’ll also learn how to conduct effective competitive content analysis and internal content audits. You’ll learn how to create a site-wide content strategy building on the data we uncover in our study and analysis of content. And finally, you'll review the topic of local SEO, what local SEO is, and how it is both similar to and different from regular SEO tactics and best practices. Let's get started!

1.01.	Introduction
 
Hello. My name is Rebekah May. I'd like to welcome you to the third course in our study of SEO, optimizing a website for search. In this course, we move past research and into more hands-on techniques for drawing traffic to your site. You will be taking what we learned in the previous courses and putting it into action to obtain the best results for you and your clients. 
This course is divided into four modules and will guide you through the worlds of keyword research and application, advanced on-page SEO, local SEO, and creating an SEO campaign. Beginning with keywords, you'll learn how to research, select, and apply this powerful tool to optimize your website. You'll also learn about the art of identifying and analyzing your competitors and learning how they think. 
In the second module, we'll take the next step toward optimization by exploring how content can help translate clicks into increased sales or traffic. What makes a strategy succeed and what makes content great? We'll answer these questions and learn how to conduct effective content analysis, internal content audits, and how to build a domain level content strategy. 
In Module 3, we'll take a close look at local SEO strategy and how to optimize your Google business pages, on-site content, and external references to give you higher visibility in the local search landscape. We'll also look at the elements that contribute to a strong local SEO strategy. 
Finally, in Module 4, we'll discuss the human factor of SEO. How do you establish and maintain relationships with your clients? How do you manage expectations and track and report progress? These are important questions that lie at the heart of SEO. It's about helping your clients achieve the goals they have set for their websites. By the end of this course, you'll be able to apply your new skills in research, analysis, and strategy development to help your clients achieve their website and business goals.
1.02.	Applying Keyword Research Introduction
 
Welcome to the first module in this course on optimizing a website for search. In this module, we'll explore how to research, select, and apply keywords to your site. Effective use of keywords is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal for increasing traffic to your website. Identifying the best keywords for your website means not only anticipating how your potential customers think, it also involves a great deal of careful research and analysis. Let's get started on this important topic so that you can begin to develop lists of relevant natural keyword phrases.
1.03.	Why Do a Competitive Analysis?
 
Welcome back. In this lesson, we'll start to
analyze the keywords we identified earlier to determine which ones have the most potential to be
the most effective. We'll also discuss why this competitive
analysis of our keywords is an important step in optimizing site in
reaching business goals. Now that we've gone
through the process of researching and
collecting our keywords, we have to decide which
keywords are the best to use. While we ended up with a
large amount of keywords, we will actually only be using a small percentage of them. The extra keywords we don't
use are always great to have available for
future additions or changes to the website, as well as for blog post ideas. Don't completely get rid of keywords that you
didn't end up using. Also remember that
depending on how well users engage with the site and
convert for these keywords, you might want to revisit your initial keyword list and
update keywords as needed. It's important to
be able to properly estimate competitiveness
of a potential keyword. This will not only tell you if the keyword you selected
is too competitive, but will allow you to set appropriate expectations
for clients. Both clients and
employers we'll want to know how long it
takes to see results, what kind of budget they may
need to see the results, and what resources they should
put in place on a project. Proper competitive analysis
will allow you to provide your client or employer with data that helps answer
these questions. Some industries
won't have a lot of non-competitive keywords
to choose from. You'll see that even
textbook rentals is pretty competitive. I chose this example
so you can see how to effectively
analyze your competition. A competitive analysis
contains various stages. In order to effectively analyze the competition behind
a keyword or term, we must first select potential
keywords we want to use. These keywords will
be selected based on relevancy, intent,
and competitiveness. We then identify who the top against competition
is for that term. Next, evaluate what competitor sites
are doing well and areas they are lacking in. Finally, analyze our own site to identify opportunities we
have to effectively compete. I will go through
each stage in detail. Let's start with
analyzing our list of keywords and selecting potential
keywords from our list.
